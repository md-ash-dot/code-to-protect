          <h1>Modern slavery and human trafficking</h1>
          <p>
            Thousands of people across the UK are being held in squalor and
            undertaking forced labour. Some may be fleeing war zones, others may
            have financial problems, but all find dream turns to nightmare as
            their life descends into fear, debt and drudgery in exhausting,
            ill-paid, dangerous and degrading work, with escape impossible,
            forbidden or punished. Combating modern slavery and human
            trafficking is one of our highest priorities. We're working with
            partners in the UK and around the world to pursue offenders and
            safeguard victims.
